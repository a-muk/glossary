## What it is

Automation is the creation and application of technology to minimize human work and intervention as much as possible.
For example, a Chatbot - You must have visited a page which as soon as you open responds with a "hi" message thus addressing your presence, that is automation. Like this automation is being used in variety of industries like medical, automobile, packaging etc.

## Problem it addresses 

Considering the same example of Chatbot here, earlier the website owner had to hire officials to address the queries of the person visiting the website, thereby increasing the cost of the service and also increasing the hassle of the attender to interact with so many visitors. This can inturn increase the chances of mistakes in the whole process.
Automation helps administrators and operators manage environments by automating previously manual operations.
  
## How it helps

Automation speeds up administration and configuration of environments thus requiring less engineering time.
Continuing with the Chatbot example - it asks the visiter different kinds of questions and also answer theirs. So,now there is no need of hiring officials and even the chances of mistakes will get decreased leading to an increase in profits of the organization.
